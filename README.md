## About the Portfolio

This portfolio is designed to present my Mechanical Engineering projects, skills, and achievements. It serves as a digital resume and a platform to display my work to potential employers and collaborators. From structural designs to automation, you will find examples of my expertise here.

## Technologies and Tools

While Mechanical Engineering focuses on physical systems, my portfolio integrates web technologies to showcase my work:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs.
- **Nodemailer**: For sending emails from the portfolio's contact form.

- **Other Libraries**:
  - `@hookform/resolvers`
  - `@radix-ui/react-accordion`
  - `axios`
  - `class-variance-authority`
  - `clsx`
  - `framer-motion`
  - `lucide-react`
  - `react-hook-form`
  - `tailwind-merge`
  - `tailwindcss-animate`
  - `zod`

## Features

- **Project showcases**: Detailed descriptions, images, and technical specifications of my Mechanical Engineering projects, including CAD models, simulations, and designs.
- **Responsive design**: Works on various devices.
- **Contact form**: Allows users to get in touch directly via email.
- **Spam protection**: Google reCAPTCHA integration for added security.
